# personal-website
I've decided to create a simple personal website.  
## Stack  
I am currently using FastAPI as a backend, and will soon add some form of frontend.  
The website is currently hosted on a small vps, rented from a local provider. I've also configured some security measures on it, including a package that I've not used before: CrowdSec.
## Plans  
As for contents on the site, I plan to showcase personal projects, or perhaps build some kind of personal knowledgebase, containing information I've learnt throughout the years.  
  
## Theme idea  
I would like the frontend to have a terminal style theme.
