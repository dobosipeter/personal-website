# personal-website
I've decided to create a simple personal website.  
## Stack  
I am currently using FastAPI as a backend, and will soon add some form of frontend.  
## Plans  
I plan to host the website myself, on a Raspberry Pi 4. However it only has 1GB of RAM, which might be a constraint in the future. If that happens, I can either upgrade to a model with more memory, or move to a VPS.  
As for contents on the site, I plan to showcase personal projects, or perhaps build some kind of personal knowledgebase, containing information I've learnt throughout the years.
## Theme idea  
I would like the frontend to have a terminal style theme.
